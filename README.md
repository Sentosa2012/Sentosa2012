- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sentosa2012 (Aka Morgan)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything really! I'm like a sponge, I'll try my hand at anything!
- 🌱 I’m studying Cybersecurity and Forensics at Edinburgh Napier University
- 🏢 I'm currently doing an internship at TSB Bank in the IT Operations team, safeguarding service stability and soaking up any skills I can.

I'm still figuring out what I like to do and making a mess of everything I touch along the way! Hopefully I can look back at this in a few years and have a laugh, until then I'll keep breaking everything I touch (including my keyboard apparently)!
